# Privacy Policy

This GPT is an educational and demonstrational tool for Data Governance.

When Actions are enabled, the GPT may send user-provided analytical outputs (structured JSON results derived from uploaded datasets) to an external API endpoint for visualization purposes. This data is:

- Provided explicitly by the user during the session
- Processed only to store and display governance analysis results
- Not used for training, profiling, or advertising purposes
- Not shared with third parties beyond the configured demo infrastructure

No authentication credentials, personal accounts, or proprietary production systems are accessed by this GPT.

All datasets used in the demo are expected to be synthetic or anonymized and intended for educational use only.

The external service does not persist data beyond what is required to demonstrate functionality, and data can be overwritten or removed at any time.

By using this GPT, you acknowledge that you should not upload real personal data or confidential production information.
